# RedstoneDistortion
Welcome to Redstone Distortions Github page!

# 1. Why make Redstone Distortion?
Redstone Distortion is a new way of refreshing the BuildTech late consistencies with updates, ultimately, this is an
entirely new setup for BuildTech, this mod will now focus on the entirity of energy apis instead of focusing on primarily one, the reason for that is simple, as Buildcraft switched on from its Energy API, known as MJ to RF by the CofH Team, there was no mod to support the MJ API any longer, which broke many features in BuildTech since buildtech's machines relied heavily on the MJ Api, ultimately, I made the decision to remake BuildTech entirely from scratch, whilst giving it it's own and unique name, and not making it dependent on any mod except for the libs that are needed to run it.

# 2. Could I, a contributor help?
Of course! All help for development on this mod is needed, it's not like it can run with one individual (well it could, just a pain) ;). You can help by downloading the mod on github, making the modifications that you want to make and just make a PR, I'll just check over the changes and after that, your changes just contributed to the mod :)

# 3. What Mod License will they mod use in the future?
I will be using the MMPLv2 license in the near future when it is finalized, but for now, I will be using the MMPLv1 license while I still can. More information about the license can be found here: http://www.mod-buildcraft.com/MMPL-1.0.txt
