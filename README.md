# RedstoneDistortion
Welcome to Redstone Distortions Github page!

# 1. Why make Redstone Distortion?
Redstone Distortion is a new way of refreshing the BuildTech's late consistencies with updates, ultimately, this is an entirely new setup for BuildTech, this mod will now focus on the entirity of energy apis instead of focusing on primarily one, the reason for that is simple, as Buildcraft switched on from its Energy API, known as MJ to RF by the CofH Team, there was no mod to support the MJ API any longer, which broke many features in BuildTech since BuildTech's machines relied heavily on the MJ Api, ultimately, I made the decision to remake BuildTech entirely from scratch, whilst giving it it's own and unique name, and not making it dependent on any mod except for the libs that are needed to run it.

# 2. Could I, a contributor help?
Of course! All help for development on this mod is needed, it's not like it can run with one individual (well it could, just a pain) ;). You can help by downloading the mod on github, making the modifications that you want to make and just make a PR, I'll just check over the changes and after that, your changes just contributed to the mod :)

# 3. What Mod License will the mod use in the future?
I will be using the MMPLv2 license in the near future when it is finalized, but for now, I will be using the MMPLv1 license while I still can. More information about the license can be found here: http://www.mod-buildcraft.com/MMPL-1.0.txt

# 4. Will you be updating this mod every now and then?
Yes, I will be updating the mod as much as I can, with bug patches coming out every so often and a major release expected every 3-4 months apart from one another, I am doing this to help with reaching the due date for the releases sooner, instead of disappearing for x months and later popping up having nothing done, and I hate to be the one doing that, but many things do get in the way of my busy schedule, so please relax and wait for the updates. This updating schedule will start as soon as the mod is released to the public, so until then, this doesn't count for now ;).
